        The year 2024 promises to be a transformative chapter for cybersecurity, marked by emerging trends and heightened challenges. As cyber threats grow more sophisticated and frequent, staying ahead of the curve is not just an advantageâ€”it's a necessity for businesses aiming to safeguard their operations and data.

        How can businesses prepare for the increasing sophistication of cyber threats in 2024?
      </span>,
      <span className="subtitle">
        Businesses can prepare by investing in advanced threat detection systems, conducting regular security audits, and implementing robust incident response plans. Training employees on cybersecurity best practices and staying informed about emerging trends are also essential to proactively mitigate risks and protect critical data.

        ZERO TRUST

      <p className="text-post">
        Let's imagine a castle and a moat. If we are inside the castle, threats remain outside, since the perimeter outside the moat remains protected. If we transfer this metaphor to a digital environment, the problem arises when a user assumes that, with the correct access credentials, they can move freely through the system and trust that nothing will happen.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        This is the most common scenario: As much as organizations erect many security defenses, as soon as a gullible user clicks on a malicious link or attachment, they allow cybercriminals to compromise systems. In fact, it's the reason why phishing and ransomware are so harmful.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        The zero trust model restricts access to the network only to those people who need it. Based on contextual awareness, access is granted to authorized users using patterns based on identity, time, and device. Default access is removed. Now everything must pass security protocols such as access control steps and user identity verification.

        Creating an Internal Network in VirtualBox
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        To begin, it is essential to establish an internal network that allows communication between Windows Server and Windows 7 virtual machines. (<i>In my case i use WIN7, because i have many problem to virtualized WIN10</i>).
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        start by opening VirtualBox and selecting the virtual machine running Windows Server. Click on <i>"Settings"</i> and then on the <i>"Network"</i> tab. In <i>"Adapter 1,"</i> select <i>"Internal Network"</i> from the drop-down menu and name the network, e.g., <i>"InternalNetwork."</i> Follow the same procedure for the Windows 7 virtual machine, ensuring to use the same network name. This step is crucial to simulate a real network environment where virtual machines can communicate without external interference.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        Next, assign static IP addresses, which is fundamental for network management and server administration. Start the virtual machine running Windows Server, navigate to <i>"Network and Sharing Center"</i> / <i>"Change adapter settings,"</i> right-click on <i>"Ethernet,"</i> select "Properties," choose <i>"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4),"</i> and click "Properties." Set the IP address to <i>192.168.100.10</i>, with a subnet mask of <i>255.255.255.0</i> and a default gateway of <i>192.168.100.1</i>. Set the preferred DNS server to <i>192.168.100.10</i>.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        For Windows 7, follow the same steps to access network settings and assign the IP address <i>192.168.100.11</i>, using the same subnet mask and DNS settings. To verify, ping between the two machines to ensure they can communicate properly.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        Enabling remote access is crucial for server management without physical access. For Windows Server, open <i>"Server Manager,"</i> navigate to <i>"Local Server"</i> and find <i>"Remote Desktop."</i> Click "Disabled" and select <i>"Allow remote connections to this computer,"</i> unchecking <i>"Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication."</i> In Windows 7, go to "Computer" / "Properties," select "Remote settings," and under "Remote Desktop," choose <i>"Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop (less secure)."</i> Ensure that firewall settings allow RDP connections.

        ROLE IMPLEMENTATION IN WINDOWS SERVER
      </h2>,
      <p className="text-post">
        A Domain Controller (DC) is essential for the centralized management of users and computers within a network. To set up the server as a DC, open <i>"Server Manager,"</i> click "Manage" / <i>"Add Roles and Features,"</i> select <i>"Role-based or feature-based installation,"</i> choose the server from the server pool, and click "Next." Select <i>"Active Directory Domain Services"</i> and follow the prompts to install the role. After installation, click the yellow flag at the top and select <i>"Promote this server to a domain controller."</i> Choose <i>"Add a new forest"</i> and enter the domain name, such as <i>"mycompany.local."</i> Complete the wizard and restart the server when prompted.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        Organizing users into groups and Organizational Units (OUs) facilitates permission management and policy application. Open <i>"Administrative Tools"</i> / <i>"Active Directory Users and Computers."</i> Create a new Organizational Unit (OU) to organize users, and create groups such as <i>"UserGroup"</i> and <i>"AdminGroup."</i> Add users and assign them to the appropriate groups. Verify group memberships by right-clicking on a user, selecting "Properties," and then "Member Of."
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are used to enforce security settings and configurations across the network. Open <i>"Group Policy Management"</i> and create a new GPO. Link the GPO to the desired OU, edit the settings, and enforce them by running <i>"gpupdate /force"</i> in the command prompt. Verify the settings by logging in as a user and checking the applied policies.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        File sharing is a common requirement in network environments. Create a shared folder by right-clicking on a directory, selecting <i>"Properties,"</i> and navigating to the <i>"Sharing"</i> tab.

        Monitoring server performance is crucial for identifying and resolving issues before they impact users. Open <i>"Server Manager"</i> and navigate to <i>"Performance Monitor."</i> Add counters for CPU, memory, disk, and network usage to track resource utilization. Set up alerts for critical thresholds to receive notifications when performance degrades.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        Regular maintenance tasks such as installing updates and patches are essential for keeping the server secure and stable. Open <i>"Server Manager"</i> and click on <i>"Notifications."</i> Check for available updates and install them to ensure the server is up to date. Schedule regular maintenance windows to minimize downtime and disruptions to users.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        Backing up critical data is essential for disaster recovery and business continuity. Use <i>"Windows Server Backup"</i> to create a backup schedule and store backups on external drives or network shares. Test the restore process periodically to ensure that backups are valid and can be recovered in the event of data loss.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        Monitoring server logs is essential for identifying security incidents and unauthorized access attempts. Use <i>"Event Viewer"</i> to view system, security, and application logs. Set up alerts for critical events and investigate any anomalies to prevent security breaches.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        Implementing security best practices such as strong passwords, firewall rules, and antivirus software is essential for protecting the server from cyber threats. Regularly review security configurations and update policies to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
