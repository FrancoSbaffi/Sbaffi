        ZERO TRUST

      <p className="text-post">
        Let's imagine a castle and a moat. If we are inside the castle, threats remain outside, since the perimeter outside the moat remains protected. If we transfer this metaphor to a digital environment, the problem arises when a user assumes that, with the correct access credentials, they can move freely through the system and trust that nothing will happen.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        This is the most common scenario: As much as organizations erect many security defenses, as soon as a gullible user clicks on a malicious link or attachment, they allow cybercriminals to compromise systems. In fact, it's the reason why phishing and ransomware are so harmful.
      </p>,
      <p className="text-post">
        The zero trust model restricts access to the network only to those people who need it. Based on contextual awareness, access is granted to authorized users using patterns based on identity, time, and device. Default access is removed. Now everything must pass security protocols such as access control steps and user identity verification.

      Introduction
    </span>,
    <p className="p-work">
       In this project, I took a deep dive into Masa/Mura CMS, exploring its source code and identifying a significant attack surface. Over a week of dedicated analysis, 
       I discovered several potential vulnerabilities, including a critical SQL injection flaw within Appleâ€™s Book Travel portal. 
       My goal was to investigate this issue thoroughly, trace it to its source, and demonstrate how it could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). 
       Hereâ€™s how I approached and executed this project step by step.
    </p>,
    <br />,
    <span className="title-work">
      Finding the Vulnerability Sink
    </span>,
    <p className="p-work">
      While analyzing Masa/Mura CMS, I focused on its JSON API, as this exposed methods accessible within Appleâ€™s environment. 
      This API became the central point of my investigation, aiming to identify SQL injection sinks and their sources. 
      To streamline the process, I explored static analysis tools and parsers capable of detecting unsanitized inputs in the code. 
      For this, I used the cfmlparser tool, which helped identify vulnerable cfquery tags lacking proper sanitization.
    </p>,
    <p className="subtitle-work">
      Using a custom script, I:
    </p>,
    <ul className="list-work">
      <li><i>1.</i> Parsed all <span className="bg-work">.cfm</span> and <span className="bg-work">.cfc</span> files in the codebase.</li> <br />
      <li><i>2.</i> Filtered <span className="bg-work">cfquery</span> tags, ignoring those with sanitized inputs (e.g., <span className="bg-work">cfqueryparam</span> tags).</li> <br />
      <li><i>3.</i> Flagged queries with unsanitized arguments for further review.</li>
    </ul>,
    <br />,
    <p className="p-work">
      This approach revealed multiple queries, but I filtered them further based on contextual validation to focus only on exploitable inputs.
    </p>,
    <br />,
    <span className="title-work">
      Tracing the Sink to Its Source
    </span>,
    <p className="p-work">
      One vulnerable query stood out, located in the <span className="bg-work">getObjects</span> function. This query processed three arguments, among which <span className="bg-work">ContentHistID</span> was unsanitized. 
      I traced the function's usage back to its origin within the JSON API, identifying the following call stack:
    </p>,
    <p className="subtitle-work">
      <i>/</i> JSON API â†’ <span className="bg-work">processAsyncObject</span> â†’ <span className="bg-work">displayregion</span> â†’ <span className="bg-work">dspObjects()</span> â†’ <span className="bg-work">getObjects()</span>.
    </p>,
    <p className="p-work">
      At this stage, I had a clear path to test the vulnerability in the JSON API.
    </p>,
    <br />,
    <span className="title-work">
      Triggering and Exploiting the SQL Injection
    </span>,
    <p className="p-work">
      Initially, I attempted to exploit the SQL injection by passing malicious input via the <span className="bg-work">contenthistid</span> parameter. 
      However, my first attempts failed due to a condition within the <span className="bg-work">dspObjects</span> function requiring the <span className="bg-work">isOnDisplay</span> property to be true. 
      After debugging the codebase, I discovered that setting the <span className="bg-work">previewID</span> parameter would indirectly satisfy this condition. Using this insight, 
      I successfully triggered the SQL injection with the following request:
    </p>,
    <div className="code-snippet">
    <pre>
      <code>
        /_api/json/v1/default/?method=processAsyncObject&amp;object=displayregion&amp;contenthistid=x%5c&apos;&amp;previewID=x
      </code>
    </pre>
  </div>,
  <p className="p-work">
    This turned out to be an error-based SQL injection, allowing me to extract sensitive information from the database.
  </p>,
  <br />,
  <span className="title-work">
    Achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  </span>,
  <p className="p-subtitle">
    To escalate the impact of this vulnerability, I:
  </p>,
  <ul className="list-work">
    <li><i>1.</i> Reset an admin user's password using SQL injection.</li> <br />
    <li><i>2.</i> Extracted the reset token and user ID from the database.</li> <br />
    <li><i>3.</i> Used the password reset endpoint to log in as an admin.</li> <br />
    <li><i>4.</i> Uploaded a malicious CFM file through the admin interface, achieving RCE.</li>
  </ul>,
  <p className="p-work">
    In Appleâ€™s production environment, the SQL injection was blind, but with scripting, I was able to exfiltrate UUIDs and repeat the process successfully.
  </p>,
  <br />,
  <span className="title-work">
    Reporting and Disclosure
  </span>,
  <p className="p-work">
    After successfully exploiting the SQL injection and achieving RCE, I reported my findings to Appleâ€™s security team. 
    I provided a detailed report outlining the vulnerability, its impact, and the steps to reproduce it. 
    Apple acknowledged the issue and promptly patched the vulnerability, ensuring the security of their Book Travel portal.

  <ul className="list-work">

  <p className="p-work">
    This project showcased the critical importance of proactive code review and vulnerability assessment. By leveraging tools like <span className="bg-work">cfmlparser</span> and engaging in responsible disclosure, I not only uncovered significant security risks but also contributed to improving the security posture of widely used software. This experience reinforced my skills in static code analysis, exploit development, and collaborative problem-solving.

      Introduction
    </span>,
    <p className="p-work">
      In this project, I developed a Log File Analyzer to identify security events and anomalies within server log files. 
      The objective was to extract meaningful insights, detect potential threats, and recommend actionable solutions. 
      By leveraging log analysis tools and Python for scripting, I simulated a real-world scenario where monitoring and 
      analyzing log data are critical for maintaining cybersecurity. This guide outlines the step-by-step process of building and 
      executing the Log File Analyzer project.

    </p>,
    <p className="p-work">
      I obtained server logs from a Linux-based environment, including syslog, auth.log, and web server logs (e.g., Apache or Nginx). These files were exported from a virtual server set up in VirtualBox with Ubuntu installed. Using scp or direct file access, I transferred the logs to my analysis environment for processing. A test dataset was also created by simulating different types of suspicious activities, such as failed login attempts and unauthorized access attempts, to ensure diverse scenarios for analysis.
